TA Response:
What are the problems listed in VSCode? And could I see your files in your sidebar?

As for problems my VSCode doesn't show me any, my java file also doesn't show any problems.

Reflection:
Something that I've taken away from my lab experience this quarter was how in depth debugging goes and how crucial it is when making programs. From all of the debugging scenarios in class to the ones made in lecture by accident, I've found that being able to break up code and criticially think about how and why a problem is occuring is an important yet difficult skill to learn. It's been cool to see different methods of debugging as well as different ways to check coe and crate tests (example: JUnit). Overall debugging is an interesting process that I was able to learn more about this quarter.
