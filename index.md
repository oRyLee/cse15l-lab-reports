- open a new terminal in VScode 
- type in, ```ssh``` + your course-specific username + ```@ieng6.ucsd.edu```
- a prompt for account conditions may pop up, if it does click allow
- once everything is done you should be connected and met with a terminal that looks similar to the terminal in the image below

Step 3: Testing out Commands
- once you're all set up, you can try some commands!
- some common commmands are 

```cd```<path>  - stands for "change directory", and is used to change the current working directory to the given path    
```ls``` <path> - stands for "list" and is used to list the folders and files within the given path   
```pwd``` - stands for "print working directory", and it'll display the current working directory   
```cp``` - stands for "class path", this causes java to search for class files
 
- you can use commands such as the one above in the terminal for different functions
- there's an example of a command used in a terminal down below!

 ```ls - lat```
